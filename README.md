Hey Flores is a flower shop in Tashkent that does not have its own website yet. As a result, I built a website dedicated to bouquets and flowers special for them. The site is divided into five sections: home, about us, bouquets, location, and log-in. Every page has a header, main body, and footer. Header, section, main, footer, and header are examples of semantic tags. I used forms, input, cards, buttons, rating, and social media banners to build the site. Font Awesome provided the icons, while Pexels.com provided the images. The major section of the site is on the first page, followed by a variety of flowers with pricing and a footer at the bottom. I provided general information about this floral company on the second page. The following page describes the site where you may view, choose, and order flowers. The most recent registration page, where customers may purchase bouquets and flowers online. A Java script was used for registration so that the user could check if s/he had registered or not. A responsive component was also developed for tablet and mobile devices.
